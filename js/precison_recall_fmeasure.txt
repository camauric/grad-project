I had a friend provide 20 questions about entering a graduate programd: (see below)

1.  Do you offer scholarships/fellowships
2.  What forms of financial aid is offered
3.  Are advisors assigned or do students select their own advisors
4.  Are GRE test scores required
5.  Are there internship opportunities available onsite/on campus
6.  Are test scores & GPA weighed heavily during the application/admissions process
7.  Is going to graduate school part-time an option or do you have to go full-time
8.  About how many students are in each class (estimate)/are class sizes large or small, etc.
9.  What is the reputation of the grad school/program
10. What is the average cost to attend this grad school/program
11. What are the application deadlines
12. Is housing available for grad students
13. Is the grad school/program accredited
14. Are there any application fees and/or waivers 
15. Do you take transfer credits
16. Are assistantships offered 
17. What is the rate of employment for graduates
18. What is the minimum GPA required to be accepted into this grad school
19. How many credits are required to complete the program/graduate
20. How long will it take to complete grad school/program
21. Do students have to publish an article or do a master's project before graduation
22. Is the student body diverse

I chose 10 at random:

1.  Do you offer scholarships/fellowships
2.  What forms of financial aid is offered
3.  Are there any application fees and/or waivers
4.  What are the application deadlines
5.  On average, how long will it take to complete grad school/program
6.  Is housing available for grad students
7.  Are GRE test scores required
8.  Do students have to publish an article or do a master's project before graduation
9.  What is the minimum GPA required to be accepted into this grad school
10. How long will it take to complete grad school/program

I performed recall and precision with the 10 questions WITHOUT including the answers in the matrix and 
fmeasure(F=2*(precision*recall)/(precision+recall), and the results are below:

   Conclusion, both methods have the same average f-measure score. Only notable difference between the two is that when including answers the cos similarity went down for one question which made it not appear as a definitive answer.
