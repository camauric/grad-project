    "answer":"<h3>I can't finish my program in six years. What should I do?<\/h3><p>College of Graduate Studies and Research policy states that all credits applicable to the degree must have been completed within a maximum of six years prior to the granting of the master's degree. This includes transfer credits, submission of thesis, defense of thesis, submission of research projects, completion of practicum or internship and the course credits required for the degree. If a student fails to complete his or her program in 6 years, coursework that is more than six years old will be considered outdated and must be retaken.&nbsp;Extensions of currency, in which an outdated course can be considered current by the program and the College of Graduate Studies and Research,&nbsp;are not routine, but may be granted under special circumstances. The student must submit a formal petition&nbsp;in order to apply for an exception to this&nbsp;6 year rule. The form for that&nbsp;petition is called a <strong>Time Extension Request Form <\/strong>and can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.neiu.edu/academics/registrar-services/forms#graduate\">Time Extension Request Form<\/a>.<\/p>",

    "answer":"<h3>I have been away from Northeastern for longer than a year. I tried to return and register for courses, but I'm told that I'm \"inactive\". What do I do? <\/h3><p>An inactive student is a student who has been absent from their graduate program&nbsp;for 3 consecutive terms&nbsp;(including summer). An inactive student&nbsp;who wants to come back to complete their program will need to apply to Northeastern and the program for re-admission.&nbsp; Besides filling out a new application and paying the application fee, they will only need to provide transcripts from schools they’ve attended since they left NEIU.&nbsp; (Recommendation letters, test scores, and other documents will already be on file in Graduate Admissions.) The admissions packet will be sent to the program for their review, and it is at the discretion of the program whether the inactive student can return. The student would be admitted for an upcoming semester, and would be under a new catalog year. Coursework from their previous time in the program can still count towards their degree, if the courses (1) meet the program requirements of the new catalog year and (2) were taken within 6 years of the planned graduation date. For more information, visit the <a href=\"/future-students/how-apply/masters-degree#Readmission\">Graduate Admissions page,<\/a> which discusses re-admission to a Master's program.&nbsp;<\/p>",
